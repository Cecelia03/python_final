## Introduction

When we talk about travel, we discuss much more than physical movement between places. Travel encapsulates exploration, self-discovery, and cultural exchange, deeply influenced by the traveler’s cultural background. In today’s era, dominated by User-Generated Content (UGC) on social media platforms, shared narratives have become a treasure trove for understanding diverse tourist perceptions and behaviors (Garner & Kim, 2022). However, as global tourism becomes more interconnected, cultural differences remain critical in shaping travel preferences and evaluations (Chang et al., 2011).

To explore these dimensions, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of travel-related discourse on Chinese social platforms, focusing on keywords such as “travel,” “tourism,” and “scenic spots.” Leveraging MediaCrawler for data collection on Zhihu, a popular Chinese Q&A platform, and employing SnowNLP (a Chinese sentiment analysis model) along with Chinese stopword lists from multiple sources (e.g., Harbin Institute of Technology), we examined the emotional and cultural aspects of travel discussions. Although initial attempts on Xiaohongshu faced login restrictions, Zhihu provided an extensive dataset of questions and answers.

Interactive visualizations were built using a Dash app, though compatibility with web platforms requires further adjustments, and Plotly rendering settings, currently optimized for notebooks, will need to be adapted for web use. Graphical styles remain in their default settings, awaiting customization. Through this process, we aim to analyze the cultural and emotional dimensions of travel by comparing the experiences and perceptions of Chinese and American tourists. By integrating typologies of tourist attractions, the role of UGC, and advancements in sentiment analysis, we seek to uncover how cultural differences shape what we talk about when we talk about travel.

## Literature Review

### Tourist Attraction Typology
The systematic classification of tourist attractions has been a fundamental topic in tourism research. Leiper’s seminal work defined tourist attractions as systematic arrangements of three elements: a tourist or human element, a nucleus or central element, and a marker or informative element(Leiper, 1990). Building on this foundation, scholars have proposed various classification frameworks. Lew’s ideographic perspective categorizes attractions based on their tangible characteristics(Lew, 1987), while Richards emphasizes the role of cultural elements in attraction systems(Richards, 2002). Recent research has evolved to incorporate modern tourism developments. Based on comprehensive studies (Hofstede, 2011) and the consideration of better modeling, tourist attractions are categorized into four main types: (1) Natural Attractions: sites where the primary draw is natural resources, including national parks, mountains, and coastlines; (2) Cultural Heritage Sites: historical buildings, museums, and archaeological sites that embody cultural significance; (3) Theme Parks: purpose-built recreational facilities with specific thematic orientations; (4) Urban Attractions: modern urban spaces with tourism value.

### User-Generated Content (UGC) in Tourism
User-Generated Content refers to any form of content created and shared by end-users on digital platforms(Santos, 2021). In tourism research, UGC has emerged as a valuable data source for understanding tourist behavior and preferences. Former research indicates that more than one-third of Asia-Pacific leisure travelers rely on UGC for inspiration and ideas when choosing attractions, vacation activities, and accommodations, highlighting the significant role UGC plays in shaping their travel decisions (Del Chiappa et al., 2015). The application of social media data in tourism research has been widely validated. Lozano-Monterrubio & Huertas analyzed Barcelona’s tourist image using TripAdvisor review data(Lozano-Monterrubio & Huertas, 2020). Several former studies also explored Chinese tourists’ emotional attitudes toward cultural heritage sites through Weibo data analysis(Jia et al., 2024; Qiu & Zhang, 2021). These studies confirm that social media data can effectively reflect tourists’ authentic feelings and preferences.

### Sentiment Analysis in Tourism Context
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves the systematic identification, extraction, and study of affective states and subjective information (Yadollahi et al., 2017). In tourism research, sentiment analysis has evolved from simple polarity detection to more nuanced emotional analysis. Alaei defines tourism-specific sentiment analysis operates on the principle that textual information, such as reviews, can be categorized as either subjective (opinion-based) or objective (fact-based). In the tourism context, sentiment polarity—such as “positive” and “negative”—often corresponds to “satisfied” and “unsatisfied.”(Alaei et al., 2019). With the development of natural language processing technology, sentiment analysis has become increasingly sophisticated in tourism research. Wen achieved good results using the BERT model for hotel review sentiment analysis(Wen et al., 2023). Other former study combined topic modeling with sentiment analysis to develop a model with significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of personalized travel recommendations(Kumar & Hanji, 2024).

### Cultural Dimensions in Tourism Behavior
The impact of cultural differences on tourism experiences is a crucial topic in tourism research. Yang & Brown found significant differences in aesthetic preferences for natural landscapes between Eastern and Western tourists(Yang & Brown, 1992). Similarly, Stepchenkova’s findings further illustrate these cultural distinctions, showing that Korean tourists, representing a collectivist culture, gravitate towards popular attractions with strong social or group appeal, such as the Baikal and Far Eastern regions, often linked to trans-Siberian trains and cruises. In contrast, American tourists, rooted in an individualistic culture, display more dispersed travel patterns, prioritizing personal exploration, novelty, and adventure. This is evident in their broader geographic distribution of photos across recreational regions, reflecting cultural traits like lower uncertainty avoidance and a preference for diverse, independent experiences(Stepchenkova et al., 2015).
