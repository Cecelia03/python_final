    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\n\nTourist Attraction Typology\nThe systematic classification of tourist attractions has been a fundamental topic in tourism research. Leiper’s seminal work defined tourist attractions as systematic arrangements of three elements: a tourist or human element, a nucleus or central element, and a marker or informative element(Leiper, 1990). Building on this foundation, scholars have proposed various classification frameworks. Lew’s ideographic perspective categorizes attractions based on their tangible characteristics(Lew, 1987), while Richards emphasizes the role of cultural elements in attraction systems(Richards, 2002). Recent research has evolved to incorporate modern tourism developments. Based on comprehensive studies (Hofstede, 2011) and the consideration of better modeling, tourist attractions are categorized into four main types: (1) Natural Attractions: sites where the primary draw is natural resources, including national parks, mountains, and coastlines; (2) Cultural Heritage Sites: historical buildings, museums, and archaeological sites that embody cultural significance; (3) Theme Parks: purpose-built recreational facilities with specific thematic orientations; (4) Urban Attractions: modern urban spaces with tourism value.\n\n\nUser-Generated Content (UGC) in Tourism\nUser-Generated Content refers to any form of content created and shared by end-users on digital platforms(Santos, 2021). In tourism research, UGC has emerged as a valuable data source for understanding tourist behavior and preferences. Former research indicates that more than one-third of Asia-Pacific leisure travelers rely on UGC for inspiration and ideas when choosing attractions, vacation activities, and accommodations, highlighting the significant role UGC plays in shaping their travel decisions (Del Chiappa et al., 2015). The application of social media data in tourism research has been widely validated. Lozano-Monterrubio & Huertas analyzed Barcelona’s tourist image using TripAdvisor review data(Lozano-Monterrubio & Huertas, 2020). Several former studies also explored Chinese tourists’ emotional attitudes toward cultural heritage sites through Weibo data analysis(Jia et al., 2024; Qiu & Zhang, 2021). These studies confirm that social media data can effectively reflect tourists’ authentic feelings and preferences.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis in Tourism Context\nSentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves the systematic identification, extraction, and study of affective states and subjective information (Yadollahi et al., 2017). In tourism research, sentiment analysis has evolved from simple polarity detection to more nuanced emotional analysis. Alaei defines tourism-specific sentiment analysis operates on the principle that textual information, such as reviews, can be categorized as either subjective (opinion-based) or objective (fact-based). In the tourism context, sentiment polarity—such as “positive” and “negative”—often corresponds to “satisfied” and “unsatisfied.”(Alaei et al., 2019). With the development of natural language processing technology, sentiment analysis has become increasingly sophisticated in tourism research. Wen achieved good results using the BERT model for hotel review sentiment analysis(Wen et al., 2023). Other former study combined topic modeling with sentiment analysis to develop a model with significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of personalized travel recommendations(Kumar & Hanji, 2024).\n\n\nCultural Dimensions in Tourism Behavior\nThe impact of cultural differences on tourism experiences is a crucial topic in tourism research. Yang & Brown found significant differences in aesthetic preferences for natural landscapes between Eastern and Western tourists(Yang & Brown, 1992). Similarly, Stepchenkova’s findings further illustrate these cultural distinctions, showing that Korean tourists, representing a collectivist culture, gravitate towards popular attractions with strong social or group appeal, such as the Baikal and Far Eastern regions, often linked to trans-Siberian trains and cruises. In contrast, American tourists, rooted in an individualistic culture, display more dispersed travel patterns, prioritizing personal exploration, novelty, and adventure. This is evident in their broader geographic distribution of photos across recreational regions, reflecting cultural traits like lower uncertainty avoidance and a preference for diverse, independent experiences(Stepchenkova et al., 2015).",

In 2022, the sentiment distribution was relatively balanced, with positive sentiment dominating, but negative sentiment still showed a noticeable presence, reflected in a broader distribution of emotional values. By 2024, positive sentiment almost completely dominated, and negative sentiment significantly decreased, mainly appearing as isolated points. Overall, from 2011 to 2024, the content sentiment gradually shifted toward positivity, with a noticeable decrease in the proportion of negative sentiment, especially in 2024, where positive sentiment occupied almost the entire range of emotional values.\nIn 2021, people’s emotional feedback on scenic areas showed a clear polarization. While there were some negative or neutral reviews (represented by the dark purple region), overall, comments with high emotion values accounted for a larger proportion. This indicates that many visitors had positive experiences with the scenic areas, and the overall feedback was generally favorable.\n\n# histogram\n# category func\ndef categorize_sentiment(df, sentiment_column):\n    df['sentiment_category'] = pd.cut(df[sentiment_column], bins=[-float('inf'), 0.3, 0.7, float('inf')],\n                                      labels=['Negative', 'Neutral', 'Positive'])\n    return df\n\n\n# content text\ncontents_df = categorize_sentiment(contents_df, 'sentiment') \ncontents_text_hist = px.histogram(\n    contents_df,\n    x='sentiment_category',\n    color='sentiment_category',\n    title=\"Content Text Emotion Distribution Histogram\",\n    labels={'sentiment_category': 'Emotion Category'},\n    marginal=\"box\"\n)\n\n# content desc\ncontents_df = categorize_sentiment(contents_df, 'desc_sentiment')\ncontents_desc_hist = px.histogram(\n    contents_df,\n    x='sentiment_category',\n    color='sentiment_category',\n    title=\"Content Description Emotion Distribution Histogram\",\n    labels={'sentiment_category': 'Emotion Category'},\n    marginal=\"box\"\n)\n\n# comment\ncomments_df = categorize_sentiment(comments_df, 'sentiment')\ncomments_hist = px.histogram(\n    comments_df,\n    x='sentiment_category',\n    color='sentiment_category',\n    title=\"Comment Emotion Distribution Histogram\",\n    labels={'sentiment_category': 'Emotion Category'},\n    marginal=\"box\"\n)\n\ncontents_text_hist.show()\ncontents_desc_hist.show()\ncomments_hist.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n                                                \n\n\n                                                \n\n\nContent Description Emotion Distribution Histogram:\nThis chart shows the emotion distribution of the “desc_sentiment” field in the contents_df dataset.

    "section": "Literature Review",
    "text": "Literature Review\n\n2.1 Tourist Attraction Typology\nThe systematic classification of tourist attractions has been a fundamental topic in tourism research. Leiper’s seminal work defined tourist attractions as systematic arrangements of three elements: a tourist or human element, a nucleus or central element, and a marker or informative element(Leiper, 1990). Building on this foundation, scholars have proposed various classification frameworks. Lew’s ideographic perspective categorizes attractions based on their tangible characteristics(Lew, 1987), while Richards emphasizes the role of cultural elements in attraction systems(Richards, 2002). Recent research has evolved to incorporate modern tourism developments. Based on comprehensive studies (Hofstede, 2011) and the consideration of better modeling, tourist attractions are categorized into four main types: (1) Natural Attractions: sites where the primary draw is natural resources, including national parks, mountains, and coastlines; (2) Cultural Heritage Sites: historical buildings, museums, and archaeological sites that embody cultural significance; (3) Theme Parks: purpose-built recreational facilities with specific thematic orientations; (4) Urban Attractions: modern urban spaces with tourism value.\n\n\n2.2 User-Generated Content (UGC) in Tourism\nUser-Generated Content refers to any form of content created and shared by end-users on digital platforms(Santos, 2021). In tourism research, UGC has emerged as a valuable data source for understanding tourist behavior and preferences. Former research indicates that more than one-third of Asia-Pacific leisure travelers rely on UGC for inspiration and ideas when choosing attractions, vacation activities, and accommodations, highlighting the significant role UGC plays in shaping their travel decisions (Del Chiappa et al., 2015). The application of social media data in tourism research has been widely validated. Lozano-Monterrubio & Huertas analyzed Barcelona’s tourist image using TripAdvisor review data(Lozano-Monterrubio & Huertas, 2020). Several former studies also explored Chinese tourists’ emotional attitudes toward cultural heritage sites through Weibo data analysis(Jia et al., 2024; Qiu & Zhang, 2021). These studies confirm that social media data can effectively reflect tourists’ authentic feelings and preferences.\n\n\n2.3 Sentiment Analysis in Tourism Context\nSentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves the systematic identification, extraction, and study of affective states and subjective information (Yadollahi et al., 2017). In tourism research, sentiment analysis has evolved from simple polarity detection to more nuanced emotional analysis. Alaei defines tourism-specific sentiment analysis operates on the principle that textual information, such as reviews, can be categorized as either subjective (opinion-based) or objective (fact-based). In the tourism context, sentiment polarity—such as “positive” and “negative”—often corresponds to “satisfied” and “unsatisfied.”(Alaei et al., 2019). With the development of natural language processing technology, sentiment analysis has become increasingly sophisticated in tourism research. Wen achieved good results using the BERT model for hotel review sentiment analysis(Wen et al., 2023). Other former study combined topic modeling with sentiment analysis to develop a model with significant potential for enhancing the accuracy of personalized travel recommendations(Kumar & Hanji, 2024).\n\n\n2.4 Cultural Dimensions in Tourism Behavior\nThe impact of cultural differences on tourism experiences is a crucial topic in tourism research. Yang & Brown found significant differences in aesthetic preferences for natural landscapes between Eastern and Western tourists(Yang & Brown, 1992). Similarly, Stepchenkova’s findings further illustrate these cultural distinctions, showing that Korean tourists, representing a collectivist culture, gravitate towards popular attractions with strong social or group appeal, such as the Baikal and Far Eastern regions, often linked to trans-Siberian trains and cruises. In contrast, American tourists, rooted in an individualistic culture, display more dispersed travel patterns, prioritizing personal exploration, novelty, and adventure. This is evident in their broader geographic distribution of photos across recreational regions, reflecting cultural traits like lower uncertainty avoidance and a preference for diverse, independent experiences(Stepchenkova et al., 2015).\n\nimport json\nimport pandas as pd\nimport altair as alt\nalt.data_transformers.enable('vegafusion')\nimport numpy as np\nfrom snownlp import SnowNLP\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly import io as pio\npio.renderers.default = 'notebook'\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport dash\nfrom dash import dcc, html, Input, Output\nimport jieba\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nimport re"

    "text": "Our study focuses on the topics of travel on Chinese social platforms, employing advanced analytical tools and methods to delve into the cultural and emotional dimensions of travel discourse. By concentrating on user-generated content (UGC) from the renowned Q&A platform Zhihu and utilizing SnowNLP for sentiment analysis, we examined the evolution of travelers’ perceptions, preferences, and emotional feedback between 2011 and 2024.\nWe found that over this 14-year span, positive emotional trends exhibited a significant upward trajectory, while negative emotions markedly decreased. By 2024, sentiment was almost entirely dominated by positivity, whereas certain years, such as 2021, showed more pronounced emotional polarization. The rise in positive sentiment reflects travelers’ growing satisfaction with and trust in online information.\nUGC demonstrates immense value in understanding tourist behavior and preferences. Sentiment distribution across content and comments shows that positive emotions dominate, with negative emotions being relatively rare. This finding further validates the critical role of social media platforms in shaping and reflecting travelers’ perceptions. Cultural and natural attractions were frequently mentioned in UGC discussions, aligning with existing taxonomies of tourist attractions. Cluster analysis revealed distinct themes and emotional patterns, highlighting varying emphases on experiences such as natural landscapes, cultural heritage, and urban exploration. Analysis of engagement metrics, including likes and comments, indicated a steady annual increase in user interaction. The correlation between sentiment scores and engagement data underscores the significant impact of emotional appeal on content popularity. Our findings further confirm the cultural dimension’s influence on travel behavior. UGC reveals that collectivist cultures (e.g., Chinese tourists) tend to favor socially appealing popular attractions, while individualist cultures (e.g., Western tourists) prefer diverse and independent experiences.\nAlthough the predictive accuracy of the model is moderate (R² = 0.5779), the results suggest that engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and sub-comments can partially predict sentiment scores. The relatively low mean squared error (MSE = 0.05076) indicates limited bias in the model, but incorporating additional features (e.g., content length or thematic keywords) offers potential for improvement.\nBased on our findings, we propose several recommendations. The upward trend in positive sentiment suggests the potential to leverage UGC in promotional activities. Tourism agencies and destination marketers can use these insights to design promotional content that aligns with travelers’ emotional preferences. Understanding how different cultures influence travel behavior can help destinations provide more personalized experiences. For example, collectivist travelers may prefer group activities, while individualist travelers might favor free exploration or adventure experiences. In the future, introducing more features (e.g., linguistic nuances, visual data, and real-time engagement metrics) to optimize predictive models will provide deeper insights into emotional dynamics. In summary, this study reveals the complex interplay between cultural influences, emotional dimensions, and UGC in shaping travel discourse. These findings not only provide theoretical support for understanding how digital platforms reflect and influence travel experiences but also offer significant reference value for tourism research and practice.",
